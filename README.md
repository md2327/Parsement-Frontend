## Lessons Learned

Parsement taught me the importance of patience, project planning, and time management. Jumping head first into a project with just an idea was fine, until I wanted more features with limited time for implementation and debugging. In the future, I would like to properly plan my projects, code a bit everyday, and set a deadline for deployment.

In terms of technical skills, Parsement allowed me to become comfortable working with React, Git, and CSS. In addition, I learned the importance of securely handling an API key with a backend server.

I overcame the challenges of Parsement by stepping away from the code and coming back at a later time. In some cases, the answer to the errors were right in front of me.

While there are room for improvements, I did enjoy building, testing, and debugging Parsement.
